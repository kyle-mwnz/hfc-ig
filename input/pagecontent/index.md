This is the Implementation Guide which describes terminology artifacts (code systems, value sets and concept maps which are common to HIP FHIR services but not defined in the  NZBase or HISO terminology servers


### Description of tabs

* **Business view:**  Business context of the HPI
* **Terminology:** The ValueSets and CodeSystems defined by the guide. 
* **FAQ:** Frequently Asked Questions
* **Artifact Index:** A page with all artifacts (Logical Models, Profiles, Extensions, Terminology and others) defined in this guide. This page largely duplicates information in the Profiles and Extensions tab.
* **Support** Links to the FHIR spec and downloads. 

### Identifiers

This IG makes extensive use of identifiers - such as the Common Person Number (CPN). These
are defined in the [New Zealand Base IG](http://hl7.org.nz/fhir/ig/base/) on the identifiers tab there.

Note that these identifiers are correct as at the time of publishing the Base IG. When
new identifiers are added, they will be present in the [build version](http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7NZ/nzbase/branches/master/index.html) of NZBase (that has not yet been approved for release)
